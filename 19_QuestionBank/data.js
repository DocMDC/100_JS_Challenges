        question: 'A 57-year-old male is brought to the emergency department by his wife with shortness of breath that started 4 hours ago. Associated symptoms include a worsening cough. The patient has a past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He continues to smoke 1 pack per day for the past 30 years. His temperature is 99.3 F (37.4 C), pulse is 111/min, respirations are 22, blood pressure is 129/83 mmHg, and O2 saturation is 86%. Physical examination reveals respiratory distress, prolonged expiratory phase of respiration, and diffuse wheezing. Which of the following methods of cellular transport occurs in the lungs when oxygen and carbon monoxide are exchanged?',

        <p>The patient in the vignette shows classic signs and symptoms of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Typical presentation includes increased dyspnea, increased cough frequency or severity, and sputum production. Diagnostic workup may include a chest x-ray which would reveal hyperinflation and arterial blood gas which would reveal hypoxia and CO2 retention. In the lungs, alveoli exchange inhaled O2 for CO2 from capillaries. The exchange of both of these goes from a high concentration to a low concentration <strong>(Choice A)</strong>. Thus, the transport of O2 and CO2 cannot be an example of active transport. Only transport from low to high concentration requires active transport or the use of energy in the form of ATP. In general, it is important to remember the list of these 4 molecules that undergo simple diffusion: O2, CO2, lipids, and steroids.</p><br>
        <p><strong>(Choice B)</strong> Facilitated diffusion, although similar to simple diffusion in that it involves the transport of a molecule along its concentration gradient, has an important difference. Facilitated diffusion involves the use of a transporter or channel whereas in simple diffusion, molecules move freely across the cell membrane without the help of any proteins.</p><br>
        <p><strong>(Choice C)</strong> Primary active transport is one form of active transport. This means that it involves the transport of a molecule from low concentration to high concentration; something that is not energetically favorable. Therefore, energy in the form of ATP is utilized to push the molecule into the already crowded area.</p><br>
        <p><strong>(Choice D)</strong> Secondary active transport must be distinguished from primary active transport. As another form of active transport, secondary active transport also involves the transport of a molecule against its concentration gradient. With that said, secondary active transport occurs as a result of the actions of primary active transport. For example, primary active transport can result in a sodium gradient. This sodium gradient can be used by another molecule, such as glucose, to help it flow against its concentration gradient. Since the ATP was not used directly in the transferring of the glucose in this situation, it would be an example of secondary active transport.</p>`

        question: 'A 17-year-old female is brought to the emergency room by her parents after being hit in the side of the head with a softball during a softball game. She initially blacked out momentarily but appeared to be ok until an hour later when she developed a severe headache and started to vomit. It was at this point that she came to the ER. In the ER she is afebrile with a blood pressure of 131/82, pulse of 119/min, oxygen saturation of 97 percent. She is distressed and unable to consistently respond to questions.

        <p>This patient presents with an epidural hematoma. An epidural hematoma may present with a lucid period in which the patient is relatively asymptomatic for a period of time prior to clinical decompensation. The expanding hematoma places pressure on the brain and can lead to herniation. One of the first signs of uncal herniation is an ipsilaterally dilated pupil due to external compression of cranial nerve III. Epidural hematomas are most commonly caused by trauma to the temporal bone which ruptures the middle meningeal artery. The middle meningeal artery comes off of the internal maxillary artery, which is a branch of the external carotid artery <strong>(Choice B)</strong>.</p><br>
        <p><strong>(Choice A)</strong> A cingulate herniation may lead to compression of the anterior cerebral artery. However, compression of the anterior cerebral would present with contralateral paralysis and sensory loss of the lower extremity, not an ipsilaterally dilated pupil.</p><br>
        <p><strong>(Choice C)</strong> The internal carotid artery supplies the various arteries that perfuse the brain. However, damage to the internal carotid artery does not result in an epidural hematoma.</p><br>
        <p><strong>(Choice D)</strong> Damage to the middle cerebral artery results in contralateral motor and sensory loss of the face and upper limb, and possibly expressive or receptive aphasia. It is not involved in the pathogenesis of an epidural hematoma.</p>`

        <p>The internal thoracic artery <strong>(Choice C) </strong> is a branch off the subclavian artery that courses deep to the sternum giving rise to segmental anterior intercostal arteries. The anterior intercostal arteries form collateral circuits with the posterior intercostal arteries that arise segmentally off the aorta. During coarctation of the aorta, the blood will reroute through the internal thoracic arteries →  anterior intercostal arteries →  posterior intercostal arteries →  aorta. This collatery circuitry allows the distal aorta to receive blood despite the coarctation in the aortic arch. It should be noted, that the stem states the patient presents with a radio-femoral lag and high blood pressure in both upper extremities which is consistent with aortic coarctation distal to the major arterial branches.</p><br>

        <p>The five assumptions of the Hardy Weinberg Principle are 1) No natural selection, 2) Random mating, 3) Large populations, 4) No mutation, and 5) No migration (“gene flow”). Of the answer choices, only <strong>(Choice D)</strong> does not violate any of these assumptions. A disease phenotype that occurs only in postmenopausal women would not be subject to natural selection (no decrease in mating fitness, since the disease occurs after reproductive years).</p><br>
        <p><strong>(Choice A)</strong> If homozygosity for an allele were lethal, this would cause significant selective pressure against that allele, violating the “no natural selection” assumption.</p><br>

        <p><strong>(Choice C)</strong> This answer choice violates the random mating assumption and the large population assumption.

        question: 'A 18-month old boy is brought to the physician for recurrent abscesses present on his face and scalp. In addition, he has also had multiple episodes of sinusitis and otitis that have been treated with antibiotics, as well as episodes of diffuse eczema several weeks after he was born. The mother says her pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated, but the delivering physician had noted a broad nasal bridge. Further karyotyping revealed no abnormalities. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination of the abscesses reveals that they are cold and lack erythema. Laboratory testing is performed and reveals elevated levels of IgE and eosinophils. Which of the following cell types is likely deficient in this patient?',

        explanation: `<div class="explanation-content-text">
        <p>This young boy is presenting with recurrent infections, cold abscesses, facial dysmorphism, eczema, and elevated serum IgE levels; this is likely indicative of hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome, also known as Job syndrome. Job syndrome is due to a mutation in STAT3, which results in a deficiency of Th17 cells <strong>(Choice C)</strong>. Th17 cells are a subset of T helper cells that secrete IL-17. IL-17 plays a vital role in neutrophil and macrophage recruitment to the site of infection. Susceptibility to infection is due to the deficiency of Th17 cells, which results in impaired neutrophil proliferation and chemotaxis, decreased inflammation, and increased susceptibility to Candida and bacterial infections. The lack of neutrophils at sites of infections explain the presence of cold abscesses, lacking warmth and erythema, since neutrophils normally secrete inflammatory cytokines.</p><br>
        <p><strong>(Choice A)</strong> B-cells fail to develop in X-linked (Bruton) agammaglobulinemia. This is caused by a defect in the gene BTK and results in no B-cell maturation. Although these patients also have recurrent bacterial and enteroviral infections, this patient\’s other symptoms of eczema and cold skin abscesses suggest a different immunodeficiency.</p><br>
        <p><strong>(Choice B)</strong> A dysfunction in the regulatory T-cell lineage can lead to a condition known as immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked (IPEX) syndrome. The loss of Treg cells leads to autoimmunity as a result of disordered tolerance to self-antigens. These patients may also present with recurrent infections and eczema, but the cold abscesses seen in this patient suggest a different immunodeficiency. </p><br>
        <p><strong>(Choice D)</strong> Neutrophil deficiency, or neutropenia, can be seen in various conditions, such as bone marrow damage, and in certain viral infections. Chediak-Higashi is a specific immunodeficiency that causes pancytopenia, and can result in neutropenia. These patients typically present with recurrent infections, progressive neurodegeneration, and a characteristic albinism.</p>`

    <div class="explanation-content-text">
        <p>This newborn is likely suffering from the presence of posterior urethral valves. The newborn is male, and the ultrasound shows the key signs of the presence of posterior valves - this causes outflow obstruction which leads to a hypertrophied, thickened bladder wall, and hydronephrosis, as indicated by the enlarged kidneys and dilated ureters filled with fluid. Further, there is evidence that the patient developed Potter syndrome as indicated by the facial abnormalities, the clubbed feet, and the respiratory distress  which indicates likely pulmonary hypoplasia. Recall that posterior urethral valves <strong>(Choice C)</strong> can obstruct flow of urine cause bladder wall thickening hydronephrosis and lead to oligohydramnios and without enough amniotic fluid, the fetus can be compressed leading to potter syndrome which includes the visual abnormalities and pulmonary hypoplasia which is present in our patient.</p><br>
        <p><strong>(Choice A)</strong> Duplex collecting systems wouldn\’t lead to potter syndrome since its a unilateral defect. Plus, there is no reason why a duplex collecting system would cause bladder wall hypertrophy</p><br>
        <p><strong>(Choice B)</strong> Although this can be a bilateral issue and lead to potter syndrome the problem is cysts directly causing nonfunctional kidneys so you wouldn\’t get hydronephrosis or bladder wall hypertrophy.</p><br>
