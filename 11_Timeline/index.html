                <p>During this time I was studying biology, working as an academic tutor, and preparing to take the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT). I was also heavily involved in basic laboratory research studying evolution as well as multiple volunteer activities. I graduated in 2014 with a bachelor of science (<em>cum lade</em>) and prepared to start medical school in the summer of 2014 at the University of Utah.

                <p>Medical school was an incredibly rigorous endeavor to say the least. It required 60-80 hours a week of constant studying, attending classes, and never-ending tests during the pre-clinical years. As a more senior medical student, I spent several years rotating through various medical subspecialties at multiple hospitals and outpatient clinics which typically required a staggering 80-100 hour work weeks. In the end, I crammed a seemingly impossible amount of information into my brain and can now proudly put the distinguished "M.D." after my name.</p>

                <p>After completing two years of medical school, I decided to take a leave of absence for one year to co-found a company known as Physeo (www.Physeo.com). I successfully raised venture capital, organized a team of co-founders, and began creating educational content for medical students. Over time, our company grew and I decided to take another leave of absence for two years. During this time I hired and directly managed a team of 70 people. Fastforward to today and we have approximately 1,000 videos with a team of individuals who continue to produce educational content. I continue to be minimally involved in the company today.</p>

                <p>Following medical school, I began medical residency training in clinical pathology. I am currently in my second year of residency with one more year to go. At this point in my training, I spend part of my day managing a clinical laboratory, performing microscopic evaluations of patient tissue, and interpreting laboratory results. My schedule is fairly light and allows me to have free time to pursue other interests (eg, programming).</p>

                <p>My interest in programming began when I worked closely with a software developer at my startup (Physeo). From the outside, it seemed like magic - a world which I found to be completely new, complex, creative, and interesting. I slowly began learning how to program in the evenings using free resources such a freecodecamp.org and codecademy.com. Eventually, I completed the freecodecamp tutorials on HTML, CSS, and javascript. For the past several months I have had a lot more free time and have focused heavily on improving my skills. I am currently most interested in continuing to progress as a developer while helping a company grow.</p>
